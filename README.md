Let your music be the soundtrack of your life.
Let it be the expression of emotions that
cannot be expressed by words. Create your style
to show your uniqueness.
</p>
<p>
<h3>The I-IV-V</h3>
These are the most important chords on the 
major scale.They are also called major triads, 
and they produce a sound that gives off a happy mood.
</p>
<p>
The I (one) is the root of the scale. It is the home 
of all songs. It is recommended to play the chord with an
added II note to give the chord more weight.
</p>
<p>
Most prolific pianists play the IV (four) chord as a 7th.
It is jazzy and classy but it can be used on any genre.
You add the 7th note from the scale that the chord belongs to.
</p>
<p>
It is always advisable to play the V (5) chord just the way it is.
Don't over complicate things, it's a chord that resolves to
the I chord.

or you just wanna play happy birthday for your girlfriend on her birthday, these 
chords always fit.
